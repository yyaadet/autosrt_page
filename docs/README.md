2. Open the Terminal app. If your downloads are in the folder `~/Downloads`, you should run the command: `cd ~/Downloads`
3. Run command in the terminal: `mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/AutoSRT/Models/SentenceBERT`
4. Run command in the terminal: `cp -rf SentenceBERT.mlmodelc ~/Library/Application\ Support/AutoSRT/Models/SentenceBERT`

### LLM benchmark for translation

- Best: mistral-small3.1:24B

We found if the LLM model has more parameters, more accuracy. The gemma3:4B is obviously better than gemma3:1B. The mistra-small3.1:24B is best than any other LLM models. It can reach at least 90% translation ratio in the most time.
